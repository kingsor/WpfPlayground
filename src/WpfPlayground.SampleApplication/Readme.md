# WpfPlayground.SampleApplication

This WPF project was created following videos by Nick Cosentino in his YouTube Channel [DevLeader](https://www.youtube.com/@DevLeader).

Here is the video list I followed:

- [Love And Hate: A Beginner's Look At WPF in C#](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FENvqHO210)
- [Made EASY - WPF Dependency Injection with IServiceCollection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoQnI5St1Qg)

Now I simplified it and use it as WPF playground project.
